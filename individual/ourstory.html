                    <p class="ourstorytext">Jimmy first remembers meeting Eunjae at the old SDAFF office when he was rushing in to finish some urgent work. The operations manager at the time introduced Jimmy to her before Jimmy had to attend to his work. After a few brief encounters at work, one day Eunjae asked Jimmy for an interview she was doing as part of our course work for her Master’s program at SDSU. What was supposed to be a short interview turned into a longer interview, then dinner, and an eventual friendship. </p>

                <p>For about 3 months after the interview, Jimmy and Eunjae met frequently through work and social gatherings. When the Film Festival finally started in October and all of the festival staff were spending almost every waking hour together, Jimmy remembers sad he felt whenever him and Eunjae had to say goodbye each night and how happy he felt when he saw her again the next day. As the festival went on, his feelings for Eunjae grew, until one day he realized he needed to ask her out. On the last couple days of the Festival, he gathered the courage and finally asked Eunjae out on a date, to which she responded “Yes!” Little did Eunjae realize that “Yes!” would eventually turn out to be the start of a long (and long-distance) relationship spanning years and oceans. Though the distance has been trying, Jimmy regrets nothing and he’s thankful that Eunjae said “Yes!” on that faithful day.</p>
